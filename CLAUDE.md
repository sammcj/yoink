# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Yoink is a Chrome extension that extracts design systems from websites and outputs them as structured YAML. The YAML is optimized for AI coding assistants like Claude to understand and replicate design patterns.

**Core Purpose**: Allow users to "yoink" a website's design system (colors, typography, spacing, components, animations, etc.) and paste it into Claude to build matching UIs.

**Privacy First**: All processing happens locally in the browser. Zero network requests, no data collection, no analytics.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Development
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run build        # Full build (compile TS → bundle with esbuild → copy assets)
npm run dev          # Clean + build + watch mode
npm run watch        # Watch TypeScript files for changes

# Quality checks
npm run typecheck    # Type check without emitting files
npm run lint         # Lint TypeScript files
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run check        # Run both typecheck and lint

# Production
npm run clean        # Remove dist directory
npm run package      # Build and create zip for Chrome Web Store

# Individual build steps (usually not needed directly)
npm run compile      # TypeScript compilation only
npm run bundle       # esbuild bundling only
npm run copy-assets  # Copy HTML, CSS, icons, manifest only
```

## Architecture

### Extension Structure

The extension follows Chrome Extension Manifest V3 architecture with three main contexts:

1. **Content Script** (`src/scripts/contentScript.ts`)
   - Injected into web pages at `document_idle`
   - Orchestrates all extraction modules
   - Listens for `scanStyles` messages from popup
   - Returns extracted design system data
   - Uses DOM caching to scan page only once per extraction

2. **Background Service Worker** (`src/scripts/background.ts`)
   - Minimal implementation (MV3 requirement)
   - Currently handles installation events and basic messaging
   - Runs as ES module

3. **Popup UI** (`src/scripts/popup.ts`, `src/popup.html`, `src/styles/popup.css`)
   - Compact single-page interface
   - "Scan Page Styles" button triggers extraction
   - Checkbox to include/exclude component detection (faster without)
   - Displays YAML preview
   - Copy to clipboard and download buttons
   - Generates YAML from extracted data using `generateYAML()`

### Extraction Module System

All extraction logic is modular and located in `src/scripts/extraction/`:

**Core Extractors:**
- `styleExtractor.ts` - CSS custom properties, colors, border radius, shadows
- `typographyExtractor.ts` - Fonts, type scales, headings, body text, line heights
- `layoutExtractor.ts` - Containers, grids, flexbox, z-index, spacing patterns
- `animationExtractor.ts` - Transitions, durations, easing functions
- `domExtractor.ts` - Hierarchical DOM tree with semantic attributes
- `miscExtractors.ts` - Icons, gradients, responsive breakpoints, scrollbars

**Component Detection** (`src/scripts/extraction/components/`):
- `index.ts` - Main entry point that aggregates all component types
- `interactionComponents.ts` - Buttons, tabs, accordions, toggles
- `formComponents.ts` - Inputs, search bars, date/color pickers, comboboxes
- `contentComponents.ts` - Cards, badges, avatars, dividers, skeletons
- `feedbackComponents.ts` - Modals, tooltips, alerts, progress bars
- `navigationComponents.ts` - Navigation menus, breadcrumbs, pagination

Each component extractor detects variants, counts occurrences, extracts styles, and captures interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled).

**Utilities** (`src/scripts/utils/`):
- `domCache.ts` - Performance optimization: scan DOM once, reuse results
- `domFilters.ts` - Filter out noise (browser extensions, Tailwind utilities)
- `componentHelpers.ts` - Shared logic for component detection
- `styleHelpers.ts` - Style computation and comparison utilities
- `textProcessor.ts` - Text content extraction and sanitization

### Data Flow

1. User clicks "Scan Page Styles" in popup
2. Popup sends `scanStyles` message to content script via `chrome.tabs.sendMessage`
3. Content script calls `extractStyles(includeComponents)`
4. Content script clears caches and initializes DOM cache
5. All extractors run in parallel, using cached DOM elements
6. Content script returns `StyleExtraction` object
7. Popup receives data and calls `generateYAML()`
8. YAML is displayed, ready to copy or download

### YAML Generation Philosophy

The YAML output is designed for AI comprehension:
- **Hierarchical structure**: Follows design system mental models
- **Usage statistics**: Includes counts to show importance/frequency
- **Semantic naming**: Uses terms like "elevation levels" not just "shadows"
- **Pattern detection**: Identifies scales, ratios, and systems (e.g., "Golden Ratio typography scale")
- **Context preservation**: Shows how elements relate (color pairings, component composition)
- **Compact but complete**: Balances detail with readability

Key sections in YAML output:
- `metadata` - URL, viewport, detected patterns
- `dom-structure` - Hierarchical component tree (if components enabled)
- `colors` - Extracted colors with usage counts + CSS variables
- `typography` - Type scale, fonts, headings, body text, line heights
- `spacing` - Base unit, scale pattern, usage stats
- `shadows` - Elevation system (subtle to extra heavy)
- `layout` - Containers, grids, sidebars, fixed elements
- `z-index` - Layered by purpose (base, dropdown, modal, toast)
- `animations` - Durations, easings, transition patterns
- `icons` - SVG patterns, icon fonts, sizes
- `components` - 30+ component types with variants and states
- `flexbox-patterns` - Common flex configurations
- `component-composition` - Nesting patterns
- `responsive` - Breakpoints and media queries

## TypeScript Configuration

- **Target**: ES2020 (modern browser features)
- **Module**: ESNext with bundler resolution
- **Strict Mode**: Partially enabled (strict function types, no unused vars/params, no implicit returns)
- **Notable**: `noImplicitAny` and `strictNullChecks` are disabled for flexibility
- **Types**: Uses `@types/chrome` for extension APIs

## Build Process Details

1. **Compile** (`tsc`): TypeScript → JavaScript in `dist/`
2. **Bundle** (`esbuild`): Three separate bundles to handle different contexts
   - `contentScript.js` - IIFE format (browser environment)
   - `background.js` - ESM format (service worker)
   - `popup.js` - IIFE format (browser environment)
3. **Copy Assets**: HTML, CSS, icons, logo, manifest to `dist/`

The bundling step is critical because it resolves imports and creates single-file bundles that Chrome can load.

## Development Notes

### Loading Extension in Chrome

After building:
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `dist/` folder

When developing, run `npm run dev` and reload the extension in Chrome after code changes.

### Performance Considerations

- **DOM Cache**: `domCache.ts` scans the page once and stores results. All extractors reuse this cache.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Component detection is optional (checkbox) because it's more expensive
- **Filtering**: Aggressively filters noise (Tailwind utilities, browser extension CSS vars, generic values)
- **Thresholds**: Uses constants in `src/scripts/constants/thresholds.ts` to limit result sizes

### Extension Permissions

Minimal permissions required:
- `activeTab` - Access current tab content only when extension is clicked
- `scripting` - Inject content script to extract styles
- `clipboardWrite` - Copy YAML to clipboard

### Common Patterns

**Adding a new extractor:**
1. Create function in appropriate file under `src/scripts/extraction/`
2. Import and call from `contentScript.ts` in `extractStyles()`
3. Add return type to `StyleExtraction` interface in `src/scripts/types/extraction.ts`
4. Update `generateYAML()` in `popup.ts` to format the new data

**Adding a new component type:**
1. Add detector function in appropriate file under `src/scripts/extraction/components/`
2. Export from `components/index.ts`
3. Call from `extractComponents()` in `components/index.ts`
4. Add to `ComponentPatterns` type
5. Add YAML formatting in `generateYAML()`

**Modifying YAML output:**
- All YAML generation happens in `popup.ts` in the `generateYAML()` function
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Include usage counts for prioritization
- Limit array lengths to avoid overwhelming output (typically 3-10 items)

### Testing in Production

When testing on real websites:
- Check Console for errors (F12 → Console)
- Test on various sites (marketing sites, web apps, design system docs)
- Verify filtering works (no Tailwind utilities, no extension CSS)
- Confirm component detection accuracy
- Check YAML validity (paste into YAML parser if unsure)

### Type Safety

Types are defined in:
- `src/types/index.ts` - Legacy types (mostly unused)
- `src/scripts/types/extraction.ts` - Main extraction types

The codebase uses TypeScript but with relaxed settings for rapid development. Focus on adding types for new public APIs and exported functions.
